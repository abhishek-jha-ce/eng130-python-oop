# Object Oriented Programming in Python

## 4 Pillars of OOP

Methods/Functions
Modules
Library

#### Use Case - Benefits - example of built-in packages and libraries

- Built-in Methods increases re-usability of the code.
- By re-using code the overall size of the code is reduced.
- Code can be simplified by modularizing with the help of method.

#### Import keyword

The import keyword finds and loads a package, a sub-package or a module if they are found in the system using the import mechanism.

#### Random Method
The `random()` method returns a random floating number between 0 and 1.
```commandline
# Example Use Case - Lucky Draw
 
import random

print(random.random())
```
